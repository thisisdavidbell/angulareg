# angulareg

A project to checkout Angular js, along side node.

Created following TDD principles.

Based on: https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular

Will create an in memory db based on a json object (Storage.js) instead of Mongo.

To run all tests: `npm run test`
 - to run Storage tests: `npm run test-storage`
 - to run REST server tests: `npm run test-server`

To run server: `npm run server`


ToDo
 - implement gulp helpers
 - validate with jshint
